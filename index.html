          </a>ABOUT ME
        </h2>

          <p>A very ambitious software engineer who began his humble career in insurance sales. After wearing different hats and putting myself through school, I switched careers from finance and operations to software engineering. With the tenacity to solve complex problems and curiosity as to how to make things easy for my own sake; I started to learn programming using various resources available to me both online and offline. Right from the word go, the combination of creativity and problem solving skills gave me immense pleasure and I knew this is what I wanted to do.
          I also admire that there is so much more to learn in the realms of technology and that it is changing at an unprecedented pace.
          In the past year and half; I've worked with various clients to get experience and exposure as well as worked on other projects to gain thorough understanding of development, design and testing through udacity, MIT open courseware, and Stanford's online courses.
          Currently, I am working with the United States Airforce re-modeling comprehensive engine management system by converting SOAP transactions updates from mainframe to Oracle Data Store.
          In my spare time, I love to read, run, and spend quality time with family. I would love to learn and explore more and give back to open source community.</p>

            <p>This project provides Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The game tournament uses the Swiss systme for pairing up players in each round:
            players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible. 
            This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions) and writing the code that uses it.</p>
